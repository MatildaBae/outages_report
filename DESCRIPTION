Description: 
    Provides tools for analyzing and reporting electricity outage data. 
    The package computes common utility reliability metrics, including 
    SAIDI (System Average Interruption Duration Index), SAIFI (System Average 
    Interruption Frequency Index), and CAIDI (Customer Average Interruption 
    Duration Index). It also generates visualizations of outage trends at 
    daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly resolutions, as well as spatial 
    summaries such as borough-level outage patterns. The package assumes 
    outage data are provided as a CSV file following a predefined format and 
    is designed to support utilities in quickly and conveniently exploring 
    outage performance and reliability.
