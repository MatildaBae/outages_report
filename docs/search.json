    "text": "1 Introduction\nElectricity outage datasets are rich, high-frequency records that capture when outages occur, how long they last, how many customers are affected, and what underlying conditions or trouble codes contributed to the event. These data accumulate rapidly and contain valuable insights about system performance, resilience, and community impact. Our R package provides a streamlined framework for analyzing and visualizing electricity outage events, with tools designed specifically for event-level infrastructure data. Inspired by the design philosophy of the hurricaneexposure package, we extend these ideas to support high-resolution outage data that require daily and seasonal aggregation, restoration-time analytics, and borough-level comparisons. The package integrates clear statistical summaries, reliability metrics (such as SAIDI, SAIFI, and CAIDI), and time-series methods to uncover trends. It aims to make outage analytics more interpretable, reproducible, and accessible for utilities, policymakers, and researchers seeking data-driven insight into grid resilience and performance.",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nWe are using a dataset sourced from Con Edison’s Outage Management System (OMS). For context, Con Edison is a utility based in New York City. It provides electricity, gas, and steam for NYC and Westchester County. The OMS team analyzes and reports power outage and non-outage events across all 5 boroughs and Westchester. The event-level columns we’re using are: Event ID - a unique identifier per record Total Customers Affected - the number of customers out of power on the particular event Start Date - the date and time that the event began Restoration Date - the date and time that the power was restored for the particular event Completed Date - the date and time that the event was completed. If the event is a non-outage, the restoration and the completed date will be the same. Momentary Event Flag - displays 1 if the event is a momentary event, 0 if the event is not. Momentaries are events that are restored within 15 min of their start date. Device Type - the type of device affected on the event. Devices are the structures that provide power to customers. One device can supply power to multiple residencies. Device Outage Flag - displays 1 if the device is out, 0 if the device on the event is not. Outage Flag - displays 1 if the event has customers out of power, 0 if there are no customers affected. XBoro - the name of the Borough where the event is located Udf Municipality - For NYC, this is the name of the borough where the event is located. For Westchester, this is the name of the specific muni where the event is located. Trouble Code - the short code describing clues for the event. There is a legend mapping the trouble code short name to the long name e.g. NL = No lights, SO = Side Off.\nWe are using a year’s worth of data from October 2024 to October 2025.\nCode\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages({\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(fs)\n})\n\ndata_path    &lt;- fs::path(\"data\", \"PackageData.csv\")\noutages_raw  &lt;- readr::read_csv(data_path, show_col_types = FALSE)\n\nsource(\"scripts/MissingAnalysis.R\")\n\nsummary(outages_raw)\n\n\n   STARTDATE                      RESTDATE                  \n Min.   :2024-10-25 00:05:00   Min.   :2024-10-25 00:14:02  \n 1st Qu.:2025-02-12 16:06:54   1st Qu.:2025-02-17 10:42:30  \n Median :2025-05-08 15:32:11   Median :2025-05-12 18:03:53  \n Mean   :2025-05-02 14:21:44   Mean   :2025-05-07 11:11:02  \n 3rd Qu.:2025-07-14 05:08:01   3rd Qu.:2025-07-19 20:56:11  \n Max.   :2025-10-24 23:24:56   Max.   :2025-10-28 16:39:35  \n    COMPDATE                      EVENTID        TOTALCUSTAFFECTED\n Min.   :2024-10-25 00:14:02   Min.   :3524920   Min.   :   0.00  \n 1st Qu.:2025-02-17 12:55:53   1st Qu.:3745292   1st Qu.:   0.00  \n Median :2025-05-12 19:00:13   Median :3809224   Median :   0.00  \n Mean   :2025-05-07 14:19:10   Mean   :3815083   Mean   :   5.05  \n 3rd Qu.:2025-07-20 00:26:12   3rd Qu.:3883297   3rd Qu.:   0.00  \n Max.   :2025-10-28 16:39:36   Max.   :3954701   Max.   :5976.00  \n MOMENTARYEVENTFLAG  DEVICETYPE        DEVICEOUTAGEFLAG    OUTAGEFLAG    \n Min.   :0.0000     Length:145404      Min.   :0.00000   Min.   :0.0000  \n 1st Qu.:0.0000     Class :character   1st Qu.:0.00000   1st Qu.:0.0000  \n Median :0.0000     Mode  :character   Median :0.00000   Median :0.0000  \n Mean   :0.1185                        Mean   :0.06315   Mean   :0.1177  \n 3rd Qu.:0.0000                        3rd Qu.:0.00000   3rd Qu.:0.0000  \n Max.   :1.0000                        Max.   :1.00000   Max.   :1.0000  \n    XBORO           UDF_MUNICIPALITY   TROUBLECODE       \n Length:145404      Length:145404      Length:145404     \n Class :character   Class :character   Class :character  \n Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Mode  :character",

Empty strings were converted to missing values prior to parsing, and mixed timestamp formats were resolved using flexible parse_date_time() rules. Because some outages incorrectly reported 2023 timestamps, restoration and completion dates labeled as 2023 were shifted forward by one year. Records missing critical fields such as COMPDATE or TOTALCUSTAFFECTED were removed. Categorical fields such as XBORO were normalized to uppercase to support grouping and visualization.

    "text": "This R package provides a set of functions that users can run with their own outage datasets, as long as their data follow the same column structure as the example dataset. By calling the functions in each script, users can automatically generate the same summaries, plots, and analyses shown in this report. The goal is to make outage analytics easy to reproduce and adaptable to any similar event-level electricity data.\nAcross the daily and monthly views, the results show that most days have relatively low outage activity, but a few large spikes heavily influence the overall trends. These high-outage days also drive the monthly peaks, where certain months reach more than 2,000 outages and customer-hours lost exceed 1M. Winter and summer stand out as the busiest seasons, while spring and fall experience noticeably fewer outages.\nWhen looking at outage causes, the two major trouble codes — AMI (AMI last gasp) and SO (Side off) — account for most of the monthly variation. Both codes spike sharply in winter and again in midsummer, matching the broader seasonal patterns. The smoothed trend also highlights two main waves of outages: one in early winter and another during the summer months.\nEvent-chain analysis shows where outages tend to cluster within 5-10 minutes. Brooklyn, Queens, and Westchester have the most chain events, both in count and percentage, suggesting these areas see more rapid follow-on outages. Chain events also appear most often during late morning and early afternoon. Overall, the graphs show that outages follow strong seasonal patterns, and vary by location and trouble code.\nWe have 3 calculations for utility metrics: CAIDI, SAIFI, and SAIDI. We removed outliers for customers affected then calculated the SAIDI (System Average Interruption Duration Index) for each month. We can see for September 2025 the SAIDI was particularly high, meaning that the average outage duration for each customer served was .8 minutes SAIDI is usually measured over the course of the year, but it can still be interesting to see how each month contributed to the yearly calculation. In addition to this calculation, we also provide CAIDI and SAIFI, which we provide as functions.\nWe have a couple of visuals showing trends across our 6 boroughs, including Westchester County. We provided bar graphs, a box plot, and a ridgeline plot. Across the board, we can see that Brooklyn and Queens have a higher count of outages and that the medium duration of the outages is greater too. This may be due to factors like weather and/or equipment in these boroughs that may contribute to more outages and slower restoration times.\nWe did analysis for our trouble codes which are the clues that help operators dispatch proper resources to restore outages. We created multiple faceted plots that show the outage count for the top 5 trouble codes for each boroughs. We can see that Scheduled/Planned Work is a common trouble code across all boroughs. We also created a heat map to make trouble-code outage counts more visually appealing to the user. With the color palette that we used, we hope that users can easily determine which trouble codes are most common among the boroughs.\n\n5 Next Steps\nAs seen in the results, we did time series analysis on the outage data. We used a year’s worth of data when creating our functions and graphs, which was useful in creating visuals that show us trends throughout 2025. However, a year’s worth of data is not enough to create a model that could help us predict outage trends in coming years because the model may be shortsighted. If we could attain multiple years of outage data we could create a model that utilities can use for forecasting. Though outage data is subject to change year-to-year due to yearly differences in weather, the model can still give us insight into general outage trends throughout the year. This way utilities can gather their resources in preparation for time periods with large outages.\nIn addition to forecasting, we can also use this package to make a more interactive experience. R offers a package called Shiny that can be used to create interactive web applications, making our functionality more accessible to users that want learn more about their outage data. Users would be able to access the app directly and upload their outage data, and we can configure the app to show visuals and metrics of their choosing. Here are some additional ideas that could be helpful for our target audience: - Incorporate user-inputted fields (e.g. target KPI) so that users could compare their graphs/metrics against their target. - Add interactive filters such as check boxes, radio buttons, and drop downs to narrow the data in the report based on user need (e.g. viewing just Manhattan data instead of all 6 boroughs)",
