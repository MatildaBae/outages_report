# Conclusion

This R package provides a set of functions that users can run with their own outage datasets, as long as their data follow the same column structure as the example dataset. By calling the functions in each script, users can automatically generate the same summaries, plots, and analyses shown in this report. The goal is to make outage analytics easy to reproduce and adaptable to any similar event-level electricity data.

Across the daily and monthly views, the results show that most days have relatively low outage activity, but a few large spikes heavily influence the overall trends. These high-outage days also drive the monthly peaks, where certain months reach more than 2,000 outages and customer-hours lost exceed 1M. Winter and summer stand out as the busiest seasons, while spring and fall experience noticeably fewer outages.

When looking at outage causes, the two major trouble codes — AMI (AMI last gasp) and SO (Side off) — account for most of the monthly variation. Both codes spike sharply in winter and again in midsummer, matching the broader seasonal patterns. The smoothed trend also highlights two main waves of outages: one in early winter and another during the summer months.

Event-chain analysis shows where outages tend to cluster within 5-10 minutes. Brooklyn, Queens, and Westchester have the most chain events, both in count and percentage, suggesting these areas see more rapid follow-on outages. Chain events also appear most often during late morning and early afternoon. Overall, the graphs show that outages follow strong seasonal patterns, and vary by location and trouble code.
